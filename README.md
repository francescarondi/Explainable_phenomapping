# Explainable_phenomapping
This repository has been created as part of my master thesis

The first step of the framework is the ConvAE model by Landi et al. (available at https://github.com/landiisotta/convae_architecture).

A dimensionality reduction technique follows. It is possible to chose between PCA, t-SNE and UMAP.

Then the phenomapping is perfomermed using HDBSCAN algorithm and interpret using LIME model.
